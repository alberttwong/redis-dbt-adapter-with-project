# Dependency upgrade notes

The October 22, 2026 refresh for [issue #78](https://github.com/alberttwong/redis-dbt-adapter-with-project/issues/78)
uses PyArrow 26.0.0 in both Python runtimes and Polars 2.0.0 in the adapter test
suite. Python 3.11 is now the minimum supported version; the example retains its
existing upper bound of Python 3.13. Recreate environments with a supported
interpreter before running `uv sync --locked`.

## Compatibility changes

[PyArrow 26](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2026/10/08/26.0.0-release/) drops
Python 3.10 and requires NumPy 2.x and pandas 2.2.2+ for their optional
integrations. The example's development dependencies set the pandas floor
accordingly. The Arrow-only native v2 runtime still needs only PyArrow and the
ADBC driver manager. The oldest-dependency CI lane now uses PyArrow 26.0.0,
while retaining the existing dbt Core, dbt adapter, and ADBC manager floors.

[Polars 2](https://docs.pola.rs/releases/upgrade/2/) changes lazy collection to
use the streaming engine by default. The adapter retains normal Polars
collection behavior and converts the result with `to_arrow()`. Its existing
functional Python-model tests exercise lazy Polars results, pandas results,
Arrow tables/readers, empty results, and table replacement. Native v2 parity
also exercises Arrow Python models and the CSV loader against the pinned
engine and driver.

## Remaining upstream constraints

These versions were rechecked against PyPI release metadata on October 22,
2026. The lockfile selects the newest releases allowed by the current dbt
packages and supported Python versions. Do not override upstream requirements
to force these upgrades; recheck when dbt publishes compatible releases.

ADBC driver manager 1.12.0, hatchling 1.32.4, and dbt_utils 1.4.1 were already
current. CI audits the locked runtime and development dependencies and the
optional native v2 requirements. The Redis driver and native dbt engine remain
pinned to the implementation recorded in `v2/upstream.json`; their source
changes belong in their respective repositories.
